// Ques 1. You are tasked with creating a simple vehicle system in C++ using object-oriented programming principles. Implement a base class Vehicle and two derived classes Car and Bike. Each vehicle can perform certain common actions, but they also have specific attributes and methods.

// Requirements:

// Base Class: Vehicle
// Attributes:
// string make: The manufacturer of the vehicle.
// int year: The year the vehicle was manufactured.
// float fuel: The amount of fuel left in the vehicle.
// Methods:
// void refuel(float amount): Increases the fuel by amount.
// void display(): A virtual method that displays the vehicle's details.
// Derived Class: Car (inherits from Vehicle)
// Attributes:
// int doors: Number of doors in the car.
// Methods:
// void display(): Override the display() method to show car-specific details, including the number of doors.
// void openDoors(): A method that prints "Doors are opened."
// Derived Class: Bike (inherits from Vehicle)
// Attributes:
// bool hasCarrier: Indicates whether the bike has a carrier.
// Methods:
// void display(): Override the display() method to show bike-specific details, including whether it has a carrier.
// void kickStart(): A method that prints "Bike kick-started."
// Main Functionality:
// Create objects of Car and Bike with relevant attributes.
// Refuel both vehicles and display their details.
// Call their specific methods (openDoors() for Car and kickStart() for Bike).
