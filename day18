//Day - 18 Questions - Week-05 (September 9th, 2024)
// Ques 1: You are tasked with creating a Person class in C++ that stores details of a person, such as firstName, lastName, and age. The class should:

// Have a constructor that takes firstName, lastName, and age as arguments and initializes the member variables.
// Include a method getFullName() that returns the full name of the person (a concatenation of firstName and lastName).
// Add a method getDetails() that returns the firstName, lastName, and age in a tuple.
// Demonstrate the usage of structured bindings to unpack the tuple returned by getDetails().


#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
class Person{
    private:
    string firstname;
    string lastname;
    int age;
    public:
    Person(string fname,string lname,int a): firstname(fname),lastname(lname),age(a) {}
    string getfullname(){
        return firstname+" "+lastname;
    }
    void getdetails(){
        cout<<"First Name: "<<firstname<<endl;
        cout<<"Last Name: "<<lastname<<endl;
        cout<<"Age: "<<age<<endl;
    }
};
int main(){
    Person p("Naga Venkata Sai","Potluri",20);
    cout<<"Full Name: "<<p.getfullname()<<endl;
    p.getdetails();
}
